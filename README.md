# (Optional) Visualize Data
Before create your own model, You can visualize the dataset by running the following command to know what the data look like.

By defult, we will create two folder named `train_images` and `test_images`, and save hundreds of images in them. You can skip this step if you don't want.
```
python crowd_counting.py --num_epoch 1
```


# Training
Please delate the visualization code during training since it is slow.
